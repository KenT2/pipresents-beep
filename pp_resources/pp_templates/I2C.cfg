# USE
# ===
# This is an example configuration file for the i/o plugin pp_i2cdriver.py

# it defines input and output events and maps them to I2C device inputs and outputs

# Examples of configuration for the following I2C devices are provided
# The aim is to show the techniques, not to provide a finished article
# with error detection etc., but the drivers and examples do work.

# pp_i2cdriver.py currently supports
#  - Pimoroni Four Letter phat
#  - Pimoroni ScrollHD phat
#  - Pimoroni Automation phat (ADC only) or probably any other AD1015 ADC
#    The relays and digital inputs use pp_gpiodriver.py
#  - Adafruit MCP4725 DAC


# DRIVER SECTION
# ===============
# title = MY DEVICE   text which is reported on logs and error reports
# enabled = yes   yes/no a driver can be enabled/disabled using this so this file can be left in pp_io_config
# module = pp_i2cdriver -  the python module that implements this driver (without .py). More than one I/O config file can use the same driver.


# OUTPUT SECTIONS
# ==============
# Every section has a section name e.g. [MYSECTION1] - it may be any single word provided it is unique
# 

# direction = Every section must have a direction field whose value is out


# name  - specifies which device the section is for
#         In this example driver name is one of scrollhd, fourletter, and dac.

# type - specifies the parameter types that will be accepted
#        if name and type match the animation command then the command will be considered for execution by i2cdriver
#        there can be more than one section for a name each with a different type value.
#        this allows different preset commands for each device

# method - determines what the device identified by name/type should do.
#        some methods have other fields in the output section and/or need parameters to be specified in the animation command

# The REAL STUFF below gives an example of every animation command that I have implemented in the example I/O plugin. Others could be added.

# NOTE: in the animation command strings containing spaces must be surrounded by double quotes
# e.g. "01 02", "this is a string" 


# INPUT SECTIONS
# ==============
# There are no input sections
# The ADC runs continually if the driver is enabled and measures voltages on the three channels every 100mS.
# The result can be displayed on the Pimoroni Four letter HAT or mirroed to the DAC
# The data for each channel can be accessed in Python code in a track plugin using get_input(channel) method


# THE REAL STUFF
